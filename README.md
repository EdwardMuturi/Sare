# Sare
Sare (**Sa**vings **Re**Porter) is a **work-in-progress** personal finance android app that:
 * Track spending habits
 * Display daily, weekly and Monthly budget reports related to your finances.

**Side Note:** I wanted to skill up my UI skills in android, watched [Developing Themes with Style (Android Dev Summit '19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owkf8DhAOSo&t=1282s) and decided to try out Material theming. I wanted to try building an app from UI first with a modular approach. Thanks to material theming I think it's possible and this project tries to achieve that. Suggesgions and improvements ar PRs are are all welcome.
